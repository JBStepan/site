Hello 👋, my name is JB Stepan (aka Jakob or tonymoooon543). I’m an 18 year old kid who likes to code and mess around with computers, people say I’m weird cause my hobby is coding something which many people find trouble with.

A little bit about myself (also sorta doxing myself), I live in Iowa and will be attending a local Community College for Pre-Engineering before I transfer to Iowa State University for either Software Engineering. In my free time I like code(duh), game and write. And before someone asks “If this guy a no lifer and has no social life?”, no, I have a (mostly online) social life. My pronouns are he/him.

Now what to expect on this ‘blog’, primarily posts about things I’m working on, small life updates and maybe a political post or two idk, we’ll see where this goes. And if I go awhile without posting it’s either life is busy or my really bad ADHD has taken control and I have forgotten this thing exists.
